# Changelog for polysemy-plugin


## 0.2.3.0 (2019-09-04)
- The plugin will now choose between given effects based on the ability to unify them.
    This makes it possible for disambiguation to kick in even when using multiple
    instances of the same effect with different type variables,
    as long as type annotations/applications are used to
    target a specific instance.
- Updated the test suite to test against `polysemy-1.2.0.0`.

## 0.2.2.0 (2019-07-04)

- The plugin will now prevent some false-positives in `polysemy`'s error
    messages
- Updated the lower bounds to `polysemy-0.6.0.0`
