  where
    {- KingoftheHomeless:
      'write'' is used by the argument computation to a 'listen' or 'pass'
      in order to 'tell', rather than directly using the 'write'.
      This is because we need to temporarily store its
      'tell's seperately in order for the 'listen'/'pass' to work
      properly. Once the 'listen'/'pass' completes, we 'commit' the
      changes done to the local tvar globally through 'write'.

      'commit' is protected by 'mask'+'onException'. Combine this
      with the fact that the 'withWeavingToFinal' can't be interrupted
      by pure errors emitted by effects (since these will be
      represented as part of the functorial state), and we
      guarantee that no writes will be lost if the argument computation
      fails for whatever reason.

      The argument computation to a 'listen'/'pass' may also spawn
      asynchronous computations which do 'tell's of their own.
      In order to make sure these 'tell's won't be lost once a
      'listen'/'pass' completes, a switch is used to
      control which tvar 'write'' writes to. The switch is flipped
      atomically together with commiting the writes of the local tvar
      as part of 'commit'. Once the switch is flipped,
      any asynchrounous computations spawned by the argument
      computation will write to the global tvar instead of the local
      tvar (which is no longer relevant), and thus no writes will be
      lost.
