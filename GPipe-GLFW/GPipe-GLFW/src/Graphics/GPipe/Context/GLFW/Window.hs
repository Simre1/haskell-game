-- | Window manipulation functions covering much of the GLFW __Window guide__:
-- <http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window_guide.html>.
-- Notably absent are the window creation functions. These are handled automatically by GPipe-GLFW.
--
-- Actions are in the GPipe 'GPipe.ContextT' monad when a window handle is required,
-- otherwise they are bare reexported IO actions which can be lifted into the 'GPipe.ContextT' monad.
-- The 'Window' taken by many of these functions is the window resource from GPipe.

module Graphics.GPipe.Context.GLFW.Window (
-- * Window objects
-- | Learn more: http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window_guide.html#window_object

-- * Window event processing
-- | GLFW event processing is performed by 'GPipe-GLFW' after each call to the 'GPipe' @swapBuffers@.
-- No further action is required, but additional controls are available for complex applications in
-- "Graphics.GPipe.Context.GLFW".

-- * Window properties and events
-- | Learn more: http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window_guide.html#window_properties

-- ** Window closing and close flag
windowShouldClose,
setWindowShouldClose,
setWindowCloseCallback,

-- ** Window size
getWindowSize,

-- ** Framebuffer size
-- | Reexported from "Graphics.GPipe.Context".
GPipe.getFrameBufferSize,

-- * Buffer swapping
-- | Buffer swapping is initiated via the 'GPipe' @swapBuffers@ function.

-- * Not supported
-- | Some GLFW functionality isn't currently exposed by "Graphics.UI.GLFW".
--
--      * `glfwSetWindowUserPointer`, `glfwGetWindowUserPointer`
