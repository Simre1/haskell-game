### Need
- [x] Make separate example executables
- [x] Constraints
- [x] Collision Handling
- [x] CollideBodies component for Constraints, currently hardcoded to never collide
- [x] Remaining Collision callbacks
- [x] Add Gloss `play` version to allow interactive games
- [x] Implement body force components
- [x] Implement remaining body components
- [ ] Conversion functions between body- and world space
- [x] Implement remaining constraints
- [ ] Free FunPtrs (we currently leak a small amount of memory)
- [x] Add explicitly managed shapes whose properties you can change at runtime
- [x] Check(enforce?) proper deallocation of bodies/shapes/constraints on overwrites etc.
- [ ] Remaining spatial queries
- [x] Fix issues on [travis](https://travis-ci.org/jonascarpay/apecs-physics)
- [x] Hackage
- [x] Presolve/Postsolve collision handlers
- [x] Remaining collision properties
- [x] Wildcard collision handlers
- [x] Explicit gloss Picture component, make shapes write-only
- [ ] Haddocks
- [x] Proper SpacePtr cleanup
- [x] Proper convex polygon rendering
- [ ] Clean up pragmas
- [x] Move examples to separate package

### Want
- [x] Move rendering to separate package?
- [ ] Solve orphan instances
- [ ] Consistent variable naming
- [ ] Tests
- [x] Render Constraints
- [x] `playWorld` camera tracking?
- [ ] Documentation/tutorials?
- [ ] Switch to normal FFI instead of inline-c?
- [x] Better naming for shapes/convex
- [ ] Get constaint properties (getConstraintImpulse, getPinJointDistance, etc.)
- [ ] Include entity index from data pointer in Chipmunk error messages
- [ ] Implement remaining global properties (errorbias etc.)
- [ ] Apply(Impulse/Force)At(Local/World)
- [ ] Benchmarks
- [ ] Performance tuning (inlining etc.)
- [ ] Conditionally compiled (debug flag) warnings when setting e.g. position without a body, or density without a shape
