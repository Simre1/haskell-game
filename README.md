# haskell-game

This is my current ongoing project. Look through it if you are interested, but expect breaking changes regularly. A proper README may be available in the future.

Currently testing out whether [apecs](https://github.com/jonascarpay/apecs)(ยน) and signals work well together.

ยน: I modified apecs to work with all instances of MonadIO instead of just IO!
